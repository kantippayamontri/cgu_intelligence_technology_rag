# Workflows and agents - Docs by LangChain
This guide reviews common workflow and agent patterns.

*   Workflows have predetermined code paths and are designed to operate in a certain order.
*   Agents are dynamic and define their own processes and tool usage.

![Agent Workflow](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ/oss/images/agent_workflow.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ&q=85&s=c217c9ef517ee556cae3fc928a21dc55) LangGraph offers several benefits when building agents and workflows, including [persistence](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [streaming](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/streaming), and support for debugging as well as [deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/deploy).

Setup
-----

To build a workflow or agent, you can use [any chat model](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat) that supports structured outputs and tool calling. The following example uses Anthropic:

1.  Install dependencies:

```
pip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph

```


2.  Initialize the LLM:

```
import os
import getpass

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")

```


LLMs and augmentations
----------------------

Workflows and agentic systems are based on LLMs and the various augmentations you add to them. [Tool calling](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/tools), [structured outputs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/structured-output), and [short term memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) are a few options for tailoring LLMs to your needs. ![LLM augmentations](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ/oss/images/augmented_llm.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ&q=85&s=7ea9656f46649b3ebac19e8309ae9006)

```
# Schema for structured output
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Query that is optimized web search.")
    justification: str = Field(
        None, description="Why this query is relevant to the user's request."
    )


# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)

# Invoke the augmented LLM
output = structured_llm.invoke("How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?")

# Define a tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

# Augment the LLM with tools
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply])

# Invoke the LLM with input that triggers the tool call
msg = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 times 3?")

# Get the tool call
msg.tool_calls

```


Prompt chaining
---------------

Prompt chaining is when each LLM call processes the output of the previous call. It’s often used for performing well-defined tasks that can be broken down into smaller, verifiable steps. Some examples include:

*   Translating documents into different languages
*   Verifying generated content for consistency

![Prompt chaining](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V/oss/images/prompt_chain.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V&q=85&s=762dec147c31b8dc6ebb0857e236fc1f)

Parallelization
---------------

With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task. This is either done by running multiple independent subtasks at the same time, or running the same task multiple times to check for different outputs. Parallelization is commonly used to:

*   Split up subtasks and run them in parallel, which increases speed
*   Run tasks multiple times to check for different outputs, which increases confidence

Some examples include:

*   Running one subtask that processes a document for keywords, and a second subtask to check for formatting errors
*   Running a task multiple times that scores a document for accuracy based on different criteria, like the number of citations, the number of sources used, and the quality of the sources

![parallelization.png](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V/oss/images/parallelization.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V&q=85&s=8afe3c427d8cede6fed1e4b2a5107b71)

Routing
-------

Routing workflows process inputs and then directs them to context-specific tasks. This allows you to define specialized flows for complex tasks. For example, a workflow built to answer product related questions might process the type of question first, and then route the request to specific processes for pricing, refunds, returns, etc. ![routing.png](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V/oss/images/routing.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=dL5Sn6Cmy9pwtY0V&q=85&s=272e0e9b681b89cd7d35d5c812c50ee6)

Orchestrator-worker
-------------------

In an orchestrator-worker configuration, the orchestrator:

*   Breaks down tasks into subtasks
*   Delegates subtasks to workers
*   Synthesizes worker outputs into a final result

![worker.png](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/ybiAaBfoBvFquMDz/oss/images/worker.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=ybiAaBfoBvFquMDz&q=85&s=2e423c67cd4f12e049cea9c169ff0676) Orchestrator-worker workflows provide more flexibility and are often used when subtasks cannot be predefined the way they can with [parallelization](#parallelization). This is common with workflows that write code or need to update content across multiple files. For example, a workflow that needs to update installation instructions for multiple Python libraries across an unknown number of documents might use this pattern.

### Creating workers in LangGraph

Orchestrator-worker workflows are common and LangGraph has built-in support for them. The `Send` API lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send them specific inputs. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. The example below iterates over a list of sections and uses the `Send` API to send a section to each worker.

```
from langgraph.types import Send


# Graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str  # Report topic
    sections: list[Section]  # List of report sections
    completed_sections: Annotated[
        list, operator.add
    ]  # All workers write to this key in parallel
    final_report: str  # Final report


# Worker state
class WorkerState(TypedDict):
    section: Section
    completed_sections: Annotated[list, operator.add]


# Nodes
def orchestrator(state: State):
    """Orchestrator that generates a plan for the report"""

    # Generate queries
    report_sections = planner.invoke(
        [
            SystemMessage(content="Generate a plan for the report."),
            HumanMessage(content=f"Here is the report topic: {state['topic']}"),
        ]
    )

    return {"sections": report_sections.sections}


def llm_call(state: WorkerState):
    """Worker writes a section of the report"""

    # Generate section
    section = llm.invoke(
        [
            SystemMessage(
                content="Write a report section following the provided name and description. Include no preamble for each section. Use markdown formatting."
            ),
            HumanMessage(
                content=f"Here is the section name: {state['section'].name} and description: {state['section'].description}"
            ),
        ]
    )

    # Write the updated section to completed sections
    return {"completed_sections": [section.content]}


def synthesizer(state: State):
    """Synthesize full report from sections"""

    # List of completed sections
    completed_sections = state["completed_sections"]

    # Format completed section to str to use as context for final sections
    completed_report_sections = "\n\n---\n\n".join(completed_sections)

    return {"final_report": completed_report_sections}


# Conditional edge function to create llm_call workers that each write a section of the report
def assign_workers(state: State):
    """Assign a worker to each section in the plan"""

    # Kick off section writing in parallel via Send() API
    return [Send("llm_call", {"section": s}) for s in state["sections"]]


# Build workflow
orchestrator_worker_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add the nodes
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator)
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_node("llm_call", llm_call)
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_node("synthesizer", synthesizer)

# Add edges to connect nodes
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_edge(START, "orchestrator")
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "orchestrator", assign_workers, ["llm_call"]
)
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_edge("llm_call", "synthesizer")
orchestrator_worker_builder.add_edge("synthesizer", END)

# Compile the workflow
orchestrator_worker = orchestrator_worker_builder.compile()

# Show the workflow
display(Image(orchestrator_worker.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke
state = orchestrator_worker.invoke({"topic": "Create a report on LLM scaling laws"})

from IPython.display import Markdown
Markdown(state["final_report"])

```


Evaluator-optimizer
-------------------

In evaluator-optimizer workflows, one LLM call creates a response and the other evaluates that response. If the evaluator or a [human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) determines the response needs refinement, feedback is provided and the response is recreated. This loop continues until an acceptable response is generated. Evaluator-optimizer workflows are commonly used when there’s particular success criteria for a task, but iteration is required to meet that criteria. For example, there’s not always a perfect match when translating text between two languages. It might take a few iterations to generate a translation with the same meaning across the two languages. ![evaluator_optimizer.png](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ/oss/images/evaluator_optimizer.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ&q=85&s=9bd0474f42b6040b14ed6968a9ab4e3c)

Agents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions using [tools](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/tools). They operate in continuous feedback loops, and are used in situations where problems and solutions are unpredictable. Agents have more autonomy than workflows, and can make decisions about the tools they use and how to solve problems. You can still define the available toolset and guidelines for how agents behave. ![agent.png](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ/oss/images/agent.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ&q=85&s=bd8da41dbf8b5e6fc9ea6bb10cb63e38)

```
from langchain.tools import tool


# Define tools
@tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply `a` and `b`.

    Args:
        a: First int
        b: Second int
    """
    return a * b


@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds `a` and `b`.

    Args:
        a: First int
        b: Second int
    """
    return a + b


@tool
def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    """Divide `a` and `b`.

    Args:
        a: First int
        b: Second int
    """
    return a / b


# Augment the LLM with tools
tools = [add, multiply, divide]
tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

```
